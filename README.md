An implementation of the sha256 algorithm which I made for a school project while studying in Sofia University

I uploaded 4 different files. 
I have 2 files for the functions - one for prototype and other for implementation, and 1 main file. The text file is where you should store the text you will want to hash or the text that is going to be compared to the hashed message.
